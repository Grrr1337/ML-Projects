# Linear Regression with Multiple Learning Rates

## Overview
This is a sample that demonstrates the implementation of **Linear Regression** from scratch and explores its behavior with different learning rates. The primary focus is on visualizing the predictions and Mean Squared Error (MSE) for various learning rates.

#### Additional Functions
- `generate_and_plot_custom_rotated_datasets`:
    - Generates and plots datasets with custom rotation angles.
    - Utilizes the rotate_point function to rotate points around the origin.

## Getting Started

1. One must make sure that has the following Python libraries installed:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```
2. Run the Script:

Execute the script in your Python environment:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Note
- This script is based on the tutorial [How to implement Linear Regression from scratch with Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltXSoduiVwY).

- It is recommended to watch the tutorial for a detailed explanation of the Linear Regression implementation.
