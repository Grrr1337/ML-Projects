# ML Projects Repository
Welcome to the "ML Projects" repository! This centralized space serves as a hub for various machine learning demonstrations and projects, showcasing a diverse range of topics and algorithms. Each project is encapsulated within its own repository, allowing for easy navigation and exploration of specific areas of interest.

## Overview
This repository serves as a parent container for multiple individual projects related to machine learning. Each project is designed to provide in-depth insights, code implementations, and often interactive demos on specific machine learning concepts and techniques.


## Featured Projects
Explore a variety of machine learning topics, including but not limited to:

- **Supervised Learning**: Logistic Regression, Polynomial Regression
- **Unsupervised Learning**: KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors), K-Means Clustering, DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
- **Optimization**: Gradient Descent
- **Image Processing**: Image Segmentation, OCR-ing (Optical Character Recognition)
- **Fundamental Libraries**: Numpy Fundamentals
- **Data Visualization**: Seaborn Practice

## Getting Started
To explore a specific project, simply navigate to the corresponding repository. Each project repository contains detailed documentation, code explanations, and often interactive demos or visualizations to enhance your understanding.
