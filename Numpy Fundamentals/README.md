# NumPy Fundamentals

NumPy Fundamentals for Data Science.
This Python script provides a comprehensive overview of the **NumPy fundamentals** for data science. The code covers various aspects of NumPy, including `array creation`, `manipulation`, `data types`, and `basic operations`.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your machine -

```bash
pip install numpy
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Grrr1337/Numpy-Fundamentals.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd numpy-fundamentals
    ```
3. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python numpy_fundamentals.py
    ```

## Contents
- **create_numpy_array**: Demonstrates the creation and basic operations on a NumPy array.
- **multi_dimensional_array**: Illustrates the creation of a multi-dimensional NumPy array and provides information about its shape, dimensions, size, and data type.
- **handle_different_data_types**: Shows how NumPy handles different data types in arrays, including strings, objects, and explicit data type specification.
- **array_creation_methods**: Presents various methods for creating NumPy arrays, such as zeros, ones, and empty arrays.
- **array_creation_and_operations**: Covers different array creation methods and basic operations on arrays.
- **handle_special_values**: Explains how NumPy handles special values like NaN (Not a Number) and Infinity.
- **array_operations**: Demonstrates basic arithmetic operations on NumPy arrays.
- **broadcasting_example**: Explains broadcasting in NumPy, allowing operations on arrays of different shapes.
- **elementwise_operations**: Shows element-wise operations on NumPy arrays, such as square root.
